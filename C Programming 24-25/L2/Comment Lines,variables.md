✔︎ Variable is an identifier which is used to store data.<br>
❏ The value stored in a variable is fixed. It cannot be changed once it is initialised to a value.<br>
✔︎ Variable is the name given to a memory location.<br>
✔︎ The type of data stored in a variable is specified by its data type.<br>
<br>
//#Q5
